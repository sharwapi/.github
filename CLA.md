2.  Sublicense the Contribution under any license terms (including proprietary or commercial licenses) as We deem appropriate for the project's sustainability, subject to the covenant in Section 7.

**Revocation:** If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
